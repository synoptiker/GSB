# Tools for the Laws of Form

A project based on the conjecture that a formal description of self-organization (notably, biological systems or communication) can be based on calculi nullifying the difference of operator and operands. The famous, semigraphical calculus of forms (aka calculus of indications) of [George Spencer Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._Spencer-Brown) (GSB), which identifies distinction as an operation (cross) with distinction as the result of an operation (separated spaces), is such a calculus. Receiving some formal criticisms from the computer science community, it is nevertheless beneficial to see how the calculus can be used to describe systems, in particular, social (and socio-technical) systems:
1. In the application-oriented part of the project, several tools are designed and implemented to support field work with Spencer Brownâ€™s forms: automated and interactive tools for generating layouts of re-entry forms while optimizing the layout according to several criteria (like planarity or minimizing crossings) and apps understanding forms drawn on a tablet and generating code out of it.
2. Building on previous research in complexity theory and dynamical systems, the theoretical part of the project is devoted to a complete form analysis and form synthesis. Existing studies only consider simple re-entry forms with just one re-entry.
