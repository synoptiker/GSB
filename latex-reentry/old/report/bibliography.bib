	abstract = {How behavior and institutions are affected by social relations is one of the classic questions of social theory. This paper concerns the extent to which economic action is embedded in structures of social relations, in modern industrial society. Although the usual neoclasical accounts provide an "undersocialized" or atomized-actor explanation of such action, reformist economists who attempt to bring social structure back in do so in the "oversocialized" way criticized by Dennis Wrong. Under-and oversocialized accounts are paradoxically similar in their neglect of ongoing structures of social relations, and a sophisticated account of economic action must consider its embeddedness in such structures. The argument in illustrated by a critique of Oliver Williamson's "markets and hierarchies" research program.},

As hypothesized, individual job performance was positively related to centrality in advice networks and negatively related to centrality in hindrance networks composed of relationships tending to thwart task behaviors. Hindrance network density was significantly and negatively related to group performance.},

Relationships crossing organizational boundaries, physical barriers, or hierarchical levels can, like networks, provide unique information and diverse perspectives to individuals completing tasks at work. Egocentric and bounded network data from 101 engineers in a petrochemical company and 125 consultants in a strategy-consulting firm support our contention that both networks and ties are related to individual performance in knowledge-intensive work.},

	abstract = {Two forms of relations-dependence and interdependence-are the basis for two distinct types of social structure: 1) exchange relations and networks, and 2) groups. The structure of mutual dependence that underlies all social exchange relations is riskier than the structure of interdependence that underlies cooperation in groups. I argue that the risk of dependence is reduced, to varying degrees, by the way in which transactions are structured and organized over time. I discuss: 1) the form of transactions (negotiated or reciprocal and 2) the relations between sequential transactions (independent or serially dependent). Both negotiated transactions and serially dependent transactions reduce risk, in different ways and to varying degrees. The joint decision process of negotiated transactions changes the structure of exchange directly, by introducing elements of interdependence. Serially dependent transactions provide actors with the opportunity to change the structure, through the use of contingent action, and allow for the development of emergent aspects of exchange. Implications for research are discussed.},

It emphasizes the types of teams that are commonly used in work settings and the processes that are key to their success. The extensive literature on work teams is reviewed and organized around the shifting demands the team's life cycleâ€”from formation to disbanding. Special emphasis is given to research needs relative to team training and development and the role of team leadership.}
